# Python in High Performance Computing

Exercise material and model answers for the CSC course "Python in High Performance Computing". The course is part of PRACE Training activity at CSC.

This branch contains the version held as part of the  University of Oslo / Norbis course INF5380 [High-Performance Computing in Bioinformatics](https://github.com/torognes/inf9380/wiki)

Online version of the course is run regularly in [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/python-in-hpc). 

Articles and videos of the course are also available in a simple form in this [site](docs/mooc/index.md).
